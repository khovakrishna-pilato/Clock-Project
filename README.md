# Clock-Project

This is the first project of a long series belonging to the internship in an Italian company. We are a team of only 2 people but we are not lacking in consistency and motivation. This project focuses on the clock and its many features like countdown timer, stopwatch and alarm system. **Within a few days, we'll add comments to the various files in this repository and we will always keep this file updated, if you have any questions, suggestions or anything else, do not hesitate to contact us.** We developed this web application in just a few days (and so ***it can contain some bugs yet***) with:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Ajax
- Boostrap 5

## Explanation of HTML files ðŸ˜ƒ:

In the **index.html** file you will find our homepage. It only contains a digital clock apparently, but if you try to click the ***style*** button the time changes appearance and becomes an analog clock.  

In the **alarm.html** file you will find the alarm system. You have to choose a date after the current date/time and click on ***start alarm***. You will be shown a label with the time to go in hours, minutes and seconds until the alarm sounds. You can also choose to cancel the alarm when you want. We've chosen a bad alarm ringtone for now, but we promise to fix it in the future version. 

In the **stopwatch.html** file you will find the stopwatch. It only contains minutes, seconds and milliseconds for now, but we'll also add hours in future version. Here you can start, stop or reset the stopwatch when you want. 

while in the countdown.html file you will find the countdown system. You have to set the minutes and seconds of the stopwatch to your liking, otherwise it will start from 2 minutes. Like the stopwatch, here too you have the possibility to start, stop and reset as you wish the countdown.
